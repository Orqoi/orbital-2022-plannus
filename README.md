### Milestone 1 (Ideation) ###

# Proposed Level of Achievement
Apollo 11

# Problem motivation
As pre-undergraduates waiting to matriculate, or a freshman in Year 1, we were confused by the structure of university academics. We were not sure what modules we needed to graduate from our courses, and what pre-requisites there were for each module. Our only sources of information were friends, seniors, the course curriculum website and perhaps external platforms such as r/NUS. Unfortunately, we were unable to get information exactly catered to not only the course we were interested in, but also our preferences - specialisation, unrestricted electives, residential modules, etc. The information we needed was definitely out there, albeit in bits and pieces which makes academic planning a tedious task. To which, we thought, "Why isnâ€™t there a one stop platform for us to plan our academic journey?"

# Project Scope
The one-stop web application provides a platform for students to plan 
their modules for their entire candidature of 4 to 5 years.

# User stories
1. As a pre-undergraduate or freshman looking to start university life, I want to be able to plan out my academic progress for the next 4 years.

2. As a student worried about workload, I want to be able to look at and rate the academic plans of seniors, and ask questions.

3. As a senior, teaching assistant or professor who wants to help other students, I want to be able to post my own academic plan and answer the questions of others in a timely manner.

4. As an administrator, I want to be able to identify abuse of the system, warn them and ban them if they continue to cause problems.
