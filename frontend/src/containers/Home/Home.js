            <p>
                As part of our independent module CP2106 Independent Software Development Project (Orbital) under the Apollo 11 
                level of achievement, our team created a one stop web-application to facilitate academic planning for the entire 
                candidature of 4 to 5 years, targeted at pre-matriculating and newly matriculated students who are generally 
                less informed about the academic university structure.

            <h1>Our Motivation</h1>
            <p>
                As pre-undergraduates waiting to matriculate, or a freshman in Year 1, we were confused by the structure of university academics. We were not sure 
                what modules we needed to graduate from our courses, and what pre-requisites there were for each module. Our only sources of information were
                friends, seniors, the course curriculum website and perhaps external platforms such as r/NUS. Unfortunately, we were unable to get information 
                exactly catered to not only the course we were interested in, but also our preferences - specialisation, unrestricted electives, residential 
                modules, etc. The information we needed was definitely out there, albeit in bits and pieces which makes academic planning a tedious task. 
                To which, we thought, "Why isnâ€™t there a one stop platform for us to plan our academic journey?"
